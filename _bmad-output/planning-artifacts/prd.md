# Product Requirements Document - AI Workflow Runner

**Author:** TanNT
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** MVP Implemented

## Executive Summary

**AI Workflow Runner** is a GitHub Action that enables developers to run agentic AI workflows in CI/CD pipelines. It is the first easy way to execute AI agents (not just simple API calls) directly in GitHub Actions.

**Core Value Proposition:**

- Run agentic AI workflows with zero infrastructure management
- Setup in under 30 minutes
- Real-time visibility into AI actions via console streaming
- Built-in validation and retry for reliable automation

**Target Users:**

- Individual developers automating documentation, code review, and other AI tasks
- DevOps teams standardizing AI workflows across repositories
- Organizations scaling AI-powered automation

**Innovation:** Bridges the gap between local AI tools (require human) and self-hosted AI infrastructure (complex setup) by providing agentic AI capabilities with GitHub Actions simplicity.

### Model Selection & Free-Model Filtering (Phase 2 — Epic 10)

- **FR55:** System can enrich `list_models` output with per-model cost and a free/paid/unknown-pricing tag
- **FR56:** User can disable free models via a `disable_free_models` input

- **FR58:** User can extend subscription-provider protection via an optional `subscription_providers` config key

### Provider Fallback Chain (Phase 2 — Epic 11)

- **FR59:** User can define an ordered, cross-provider fallback chain via a `fallback_config` input (provider/model references only — no credentials)
- **FR60:** System validates each chain entry's provider is authenticated (via `auth_config`/`enabled.via`) before selection, skipping unauthenticated references with a warning
- **FR61:** System can select the first healthy provider at conversation start by watching for `session.error` before the first assistant part
- **FR62:** System can advance to the next chain entry on a startup `session.error` and start fresh
- **FR63:** System fails with an aggregated error when the entire chain is exhausted

### SDK Currency & Maintenance (Phase 2 — Epic 12)

- **FR64:** System tracks the `@opencode-ai/sdk` latest stable version and signals when the pin lags (CI guard)
- **FR65:** System keeps the `opencode-ai` CLI binary version aligned with the SDK pin

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

| NFR      | Requirement                                   | Rationale                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **NFR1** | Pre-built Docker image pull < 2 minutes on CI | Fast startup for consumers   |

### Security

| NFR      | Requirement                                             | Rationale                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **NFR5** | All env_vars masked via core.setSecret() before logging | Prevent secret exposure        |
| **NFR6** | Path traversal rejected before file access              | Prevent workspace escape       |
| **NFR7** | Error messages sanitized (no absolute paths)            | Prevent information disclosure |
| **NFR8** | Temp files created with 0o600 permissions               | Prevent unauthorized access    |
| **NFR9** | No secrets logged at any verbosity level                | Defense in depth               |

### Reliability

| NFR       | Requirement                                            | Rationale              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **NFR10** | 0% runner-caused failures                              | Core success criterion |
| **NFR11** | SIGTERM/SIGINT handled without resource leaks          | Clean CI termination   |
| **NFR12** | Event loop reconnects on transient errors (3 attempts) | Network resilience     |
| **NFR13** | Validation script timeout 60s with SIGKILL escalation  | Prevent hung scripts   |

### Integration

| NFR       | Requirement                                 | Rationale           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **NFR14** | Compatible with ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-22.04 | Primary platform    |
| **NFR15** | Compatible with self-hosted Linux + Docker  | Enterprise support  |
| **NFR16** | OpenCode SDK version pinned                 | Reproducible builds |
| **NFR17** | Outputs parseable by subsequent steps       | Composability       |

### Maintainability

| NFR       | Requirement                                   | Rationale            |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **NFR18** | Unit test coverage >= 80% on validation logic | Code quality         |
| **NFR19** | Dependabot with weekly updates                | Security maintenance |
| **NFR20** | TypeScript strict mode enabled                | Type safety          |

### Security & Logging (Phase 2)

| NFR       | Requirement                                                                                                 | Rationale                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **NFR21** | `conversation.json` and job-summary content are secret-scrubbed before write                                | `core.setSecret` masks live log only  |
| **NFR22** | No single live-log line approaches ~6k chars; full bodies go to artifact/debug file                         | Runner throughput cliff at long lines |
| **NFR23** | Auth tokens (in `auth_config`) masked via `core.setSecret` before use; `fallback_config` carries no secrets | No field-level auto-redaction of JSON |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk                         | Impact           | Mitigation                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OpenCode SDK API changes     | Breaking changes | Pin SDK version, monitor releases                                              |
| Docker image size (~1GB)     | Slow startup     | Pre-built image on GHCR eliminates per-run build; documented pull expectations |
| Low adoption                 | Project failure  | GitHub Marketplace visibility, BMAD Builder integration                        |
| Maintenance burden           | Sustainability   | Automated CI/CD, Dependabot, clear contribution guide                          |
| AI workflow unpredictability | User frustration | Validation script + retry pattern provides guardrails                          |
| GitHub Actions limitations   | Platform lock-in | Clear documentation of supported platforms                                     |

## Documentation Strategy

| Asset                 | Content                 | Location                        |
